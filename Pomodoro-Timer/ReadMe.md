# Pomodoro Timer

This project is a simple Pomodoro Timer built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a productivity tool that helps you manage your work sessions by breaking them into focused intervals.

## Features

* **Timer Display:** The main screen shows the timer in `minutes:seconds` format. It's initially set to **25:00**, a standard Pomodoro work session.
* **Start Button:** Starts the countdown for a work or break session.
* **Pause Button:** Temporarily stops the timer, allowing you to resume from where you left off.
* **Reset Button:** Resets the timer back to its initial state of 25:00.

## How It Works

The user interface is built using HTML and styled with a linked `style.css` file. The core functionality—including the countdown logic and the control of the start, pause, and reset buttons—is handled by the `script.js` file.
